          Network Name: [ Solo ] !! Example name
    Create virtual network
    !! Uncheck !!
    [] Enable IPv4 network address space definition 
    =>
    !! Don't check !!
    [] Enable IPv6 network address space definition 
    =>
    (*) Isolated virtual network
    => [Finish]	!! Firewalld has to be running else will fail. !!

If this is the first network then virbr1 and virbr1-nic will have
been created but virbr1 *won't* have an IP address.

!! If Enable IPv4... was left checked, virbr1 would have an address
[by default 192.168.100.1/24] and this is *the* [routing] problem. !!

After creating the gateway VM create (Virtual Machine Details) as
second NIC and place it on
"Virtual network 'Solo':Isolated network, internal and host routing only"

Within the gateway VM assign a suitable static IP address 
eg 192.168.240.1/24
Enable ip_forwarding and check firewall rules.
The NIC on the host side should have a static address too
eg 192.168.122.30/24
with the default router 192.168.122.1 !!why not just specify the dev? !! 

After creating the internal VM, place (Virtual Machine Details) the NIC on
"Virtual network 'Solo':Isolated network, internal and host routing only"

Within the VM configure a suitable static IP address
eg 192.168.240.20/24  and the gateway ie 192.168.240.1.

Now the host system needs a route to the internal subnet 192.168.240.0/24
which will be through VM/gateway's host side NIC ie 192.168.122.30
!!Note the virbr0 address 192.168.122.1 doesn't work. Why?!!
(A static address on VM/gateway host side NIC is desirable so dhcp 
doesn't change this address and invalidate this route.)

[net-tools]  route add -net 192.168.240.0/24 gw 192.168.122.30 dev virbr0
[iproute2] ip route add to 192.168.240.0/24 via 192.168.122.30 dev virbr0

A SNAT or MASQUERADE rule is needed in nat/POSTROUTING
eg
  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o em1 -j MASQUERADE -s 192.168.240.0/24 

(em1 is the host interface onto the world.)

I find it useful to remember that nat/POSTROUTING is almost the last thing
to touch a packet before it hits the wire.
